# API Lab

## 1. General
### Overview
Let's Work With Postman and learn API. Postman is REST API Client. We will use this tool to learn more about API, Create API calls and validate the API responses manually and programmatically.

1. Use this document to [Send your first request](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/) using postman.
    *  Can you tell us in your own word what just happened after making your first request?
2. [Create your first collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/), Collection Name: api-lab
    * Save your request from step 1 in  collection. 
    * Save all your request in this collection
3. Building a request requires many components. Please read every paragraph in this document and learn every component by implementing in your postman. [Building  Requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/).
This task will take sometime. Once you are done with this rest of the task will be very easy. Fasten Your Seat Belt and Keep moving. Enjoy the ride and joy of doing practical things!!!

## 2. Training API using AWS Cognito
### Overview
Tokenization is a very common API security proess and below API endpoint will allow you to know how to deal with oauth2 basic auth  token.
And pass it to any API which is secured by that authorization. 

1. GET TOKEN
   `curl --location --request POST 'https://izaan-test.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token' \
   --header 'Authorization: Basic MXU1aW80dmE5c3I0NW43OWZjZWcyZGFtamY6MXFia3RodnA3bGJjN2FhdnVoaG1mZzhmMmNyZWtvcjloMmg3YWJ1Mm9ydTFubHBqNzFmZQ==' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
   --data-urlencode 'scope=izaan_test/post_info' \
   --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials'`

2. Know whether you are adult, minor, senior

`
curl --location --request POST 'https://5x9m5ed0tj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test/submit' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer CognitoTokenFromCall01 \
--data-raw ````json
{
"name" : "John",
"age" : 50
}


## 3.   GitHub API
###Overview
Every REST API requires to have clean documentation for the consumers. 
GitHub uses REST API(You can just read API) for all the actions. Anything you are
able to do by using website you shall be able to do it using postman or any API client.
When you create a repo in github you are making a API call with necessary information to the
github server. We are going to learn REST API using github API documentation. Let's go and do some cool
stuff.

1. Go to GitHub Rest API Doc   See if you can, [create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#create-a-repository-for-the-authenticated-user) using API.
2. [Get a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#get-a-repository)
3. Delete a repo 
4. Create a branch
5. Read other API documentation to increase your understanding on API documentation and power of API.
